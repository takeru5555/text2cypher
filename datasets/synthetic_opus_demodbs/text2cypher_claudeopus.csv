This query does the following:

1. Matches organizations `o` that have subsidiaries `sub`.

2. Checks if the subsidiary `sub` has been dissolved (i.e. `isDissolved` property is not null and is true). 

3. Checks if there are any articles `a` mentioning the subsidiary `sub` in the last 5 years (using the `datetime()` and `duration()` functions) where the article summary contains the word ""merger"".

4. Returns the name of the organization `o` and collects the names of the merged subsidiaries.

The key aspects:

- Using `EXISTS` to efficiently check for the existence of the subsidiary and article patterns without including them in the final results.
- Checking for non-null `isDissolved` property before checking its value.
- Filtering articles in the last 5 years using Neo4j temporal functions.

1. Match any pair of Character nodes c1 and c2 that are connected by an INTERACTS2 relationship (which represents interactions in book 2).

2. Return the names of the two characters and the weight of their interaction.

- Returning the character names and interaction weight in the result",Simple Aggregation Queries,gameofthrones,True,False,False,

```cypher

This query does the following:

1. `MATCH (d:Director)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)` finds all patterns where a Director node `d` is connected to a Movie node `m` via a DIRECTED relationship.

2. `WHERE m.wonOscar = true` filters these matches to only those movies that have the `wonOscar` property set to `true`, indicating the movie won an Oscar. 

3. `RETURN DISTINCT d` returns the unique directors from the matched and filtered results. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures we only return each director once, even if they directed multiple Oscar-winning movies.

The key aspects are matching the director-movie relationship pattern, filtering for only Oscar-winning movies, and returning the distinct directors from those filtered results.",Complex Retrieval Queries,recommendations,True,False,False,

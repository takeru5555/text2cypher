# text2cypher

Repository for resources related to translating natural language into Cypher queries.

## Datasets

Includes datasets of natural language and corresponding Cypher query pairs, along with graph information for evaluation.

## Evaluation

Contains notebooks that detail different methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on the datasets provided.
Each notebook should provide a step-by-step guide on assessing model accuracy and performance in real-world scenarios.

## Finetuning

Provides notebooks and scripts for finetuning LLMs using the datasets.
These resources are intended to help improve model performance in natural language to Cypher translation.
